 arslan.1.t:0 "The Clan of Arslan Rises"
 arslan.1.desc:0 "Through shrewd marital alliances and political maneuvering, Khotun, of the Arslan clan, has successfully risen to power inside the Goshtabbi Horde. Once a mere vassal and general of the Khan, his Arslanes now command vast herds of camel-bisons and have large sway in the western areas of our domain. Our horde stands at the brink of a civil war, a religious conflict instigated by the lack of suitable grazing fields, the uncontrolled expansion of the herds and the encroaching Celestialist faith in the west. The lack of decisive response by Rothkan Goshtabbi led the clans to gather in a Kurultai, invoked by Khotun Arslan himself, a traditional gathering of the Alzhaic nobles and commanders dating back to the times of the old Alzhaic Republic, granting each member of the assembly a single vote. The die is about to be cast, and the future of all Alzha hangs in the balance! What shall we do?"
