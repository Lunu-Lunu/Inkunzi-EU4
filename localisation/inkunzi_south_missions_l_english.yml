  karpunia_military_stagnation.2.t:0 "The Humiliation in Xuaze"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.2.desc:0 "Karpunia is mighty, Karpunia is strong, Karpunia is unbeaten. Or... it should be. Despite decades upon centuries of unmatched power and dominion, the Karpunian nation has finally been challenged- no, defeated- no, *humiliated* on the field of battle, and by a bunch of upstart rebels, at that.\n\nThe war with Xuaze, and the humiliating defeat of Karpunia, has quickly become a point of national shame, with Porians across the country crying out for answers."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.2.a:0 "And we will find those answers."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.3.t:0 "The Investigation"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.3.desc:0 "The state investigation begins innocently enough. Interviews with high command seem to paint a picture of misfortunes and accidents coincidentally stacking up and heavily damaging the Karpunian war effort.\n\nNaturally, the stories quickly begin to show inconsistencies, especially as the investigation turns towards more shadowy dealings. Bribery, incompetence, and outrageously outdated strategy are endemic to the Karpunian command structure, and the root cause is clear: the unmeritocratic dominance of the nobles in the army."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.3.a:0 "Just replace all of them!"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.4.t:0 "The New Leadership"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.4.desc:0 "After half a decade of concerted state efforts, the Karpunian command is finally in an acceptable state. It is still plagued by nepotic nobles, but skilled low-ranking officers now have a reasonable route to leadership, and many of the incompetents have been soundly kicked out of the military entirely. \n\nHowever, over the course of these reforms, it has been exposed that the problems with the army run much deeper than simply the high command- which means more reform is direly needed."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.4.a:0 "It's a start."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.5.t:0 "A Meeting with the Mercenaries"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.5.desc:0 "A look into the finances of the state revealed that the price of the mercenary companies under contract with Karpunia is, simply, absurd, and it was therefore decided that the contract were up for immediate renegotiation. The best Karpunian diplomats have set out to do just that- but there is a general expectation that they will be unable to reduce the prices to something genuinely reasonable. In the meantime, we will be unable to make use of mercenaries."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.5.a:0 "I wish them the best."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.6.t:0 "End of the Negotiations"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.6.desc:0 "The diplomats set on the arduous task of renegotiating our mercenary contracts have finally returned with their results. As we expected, they were unable to negotiate the mercenaries down to reasonable prices- but nevertheless, they were able to at least somewhat fix the problem."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.6.a:0 "They did their best."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.7.t:0 "Sycophancy & Nepotism"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.7.desc:0 "As we carried out command reforms after the war with Xuaze, it was exposed that the problems of incompetence ran deeper than the top- even the lowest-ranked commanding officers are stricken with nepotism and, just as much, sycophancy. Nobles appointed cousins, friends, and even just that brown-noser is a significant problem in the lower echelons of Karpunian command. Therefore, there must be a concerted effort to uproot these problems."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.7.a:0 "Another day, another problem..."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.8.t:0 "Toadies Uprooted"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.8.desc:0 "After years of effort, thankfully with the assistance of the somewhat-reformed high command, the lower ranks have been largely cleansed of nepotism and sycophancy. This is a great leap in the progress of solving the endemic problems of the Karpunian military."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.8.a:0 "What a relief!"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.9.t:0 "Gunpowder Weapons & Modern War"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.9.desc:0 "The weapons used by the G'netans use the strange material known as 'niter', previously written off as a useless fad by the now-uprooted rot that was our former generals. However, now with our new friends, we are able to study and implement the old gunpowder weapons of the G'netans. While there is heavy pushback in the army against a full implementation, there has been a suggestion by our (competent) generals to have a limited introduction of Arquebusiers into the military."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.9.a:0 "A wonderful idea!"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.10.t:0 "The Porian Arquebusiers"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.10.desc:0 "The implementation of small groups of arquebus-wielding soldiers has gone off without a hitch. While still not the full-scale implementation that our generals would prefer, it is still a step forward in military technology."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.10.a:0 "I'd love to see them in action."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.11.t:0 "A Modern Military"
  karpunia_military_stagnation.11.desc:0 "After decades of concerted state efforts, the Karpunian military has finally, painfully, been dragged into the modern day. The arquebus is not widespread in our armies, the generals are competent, the army is meritocratic, and the mercenaries are actually paid how they should be. It is a triumph for the Karpunian government."
  karpunia_military_stagnation.11.a:0 "Long live Karpunia!"
  helghast_mission_rebuild_title:0 "Rebuild Helghast"
  helghast_mission_rebuild_desc:0 "After sitting out in the sidelines for so long, the time has come for our country to rebuild itself and rise from the ashes of its past and work towards fighting for its place in the world."

  helghast_mission_dragon_desc:0 "From the 3 eggs that were given to the great ruler of Helghast, Dark Lord Methanor White, a new species of animals came to this world. Blessed by the darkness Methanor spawned upon this world, land dragons in which the warriors of Helghast rode to battle against countless enemies."
  helghast_mission_continent_right_title:0 "Our Continental Right"
  helghast_mission_continent_right_desc:0 "Now that we have our forces ready we must leave the island to retake what was once ours, we will start by reuniting ourselves with our Helghan Brothers in Atlaheim and Helvuria who are being comanded by unrightful rulers."
